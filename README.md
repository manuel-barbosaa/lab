# my lab 🧑🏻‍🔬

a personal playground for hands-on learning, experiments, and projects as I explore the cloud native world.    

## what's inside
- **labs & experiments:** quick tests and learning exercises.  
- **projects:** end-to-end implementations with real devops practices.  
- **scripts & tools:** helpful scripts for automation and experimentation.  

## goals of this repo
- document my learning journey, so I can come back to the things I learn.
- share to the world what I've been building on my free time.
- track progress over time and reflect on improvements.

feel free to explore, reuse, or contribute!
